## Critical Problem Frequencies

### Primary Modal Issues
1. **125Hz Peak** (appears in multiple positions) - Likely room axial mode
2. **315Hz Peak** (MidRoom, corners) - Secondary modal resonance
3. **400Hz Null** (SECorner) - Destructive interference pattern
4. **1250Hz Issues** (multiple nulls) - Critical speech frequency problems

### Speech Intelligibility Assessment

**Critical Speech Range (100Hz-4kHz) Performance:**
- **Std8-HostA:** Good (±6dB variation)
- **Std8-MidRoom:** Fair (±9dB variation)  
- **Std8-HostC:** Poor (±18dB variation)
- **All Corner Positions:** Very Poor (>20dB variations)

## Acoustic Treatment Recommendations

### Priority 1: Corner Treatment (URGENT)
- **Install broadband absorbers** in all four corners
- **Target frequencies:** 100Hz-500Hz primary, extend to 2kHz
- **Recommended:** 4-6 inch thick mineral wool panels floor-to-ceiling
- **Focus areas:** NE corner (worst performance), then SE and SW corners

### Priority 2: Modal Control
- **Bass trapping** for 125Hz room mode (likely 9ft dimension)
- **Membrane absorbers** or tuned resonators for specific frequencies
- **Strategic placement** along walls at modal pressure points

### Priority 3: Mid-Frequency Diffusion
- **Install diffusers** on rear wall to break up reflections
- **Target frequencies:** 500Hz-2kHz for speech clarity
- **Avoid hard reflective surfaces** near host positions

### Priority 4: Ceiling Treatment
- **Cloud or panel system** above mixing/host area
- **Target:** Reduce ceiling reflections affecting speech clarity
- **Material:** 2-inch absorptive panels with air gap

### Priority 5: Strategic Equipment Placement
- **Primary host position:** Std8-HostA (best measured response)
- **Avoid:** All corner positions and ceiling-mounted equipment
- **Secondary option:** Std8-MidRoom with EQ correction

## EQ Correction Strategies

### Std8-HostA (Recommended Host Position)
```
125Hz: -6dB (narrow Q to target modal peak)
1250Hz: +3dB (compensate for speech clarity dip)
4kHz+: Gentle high-shelf boost (+2-3dB)
```

### Std8-MidRoom (Backup Position)
```
315Hz: -6dB (reduce modal peak)
1kHz-2kHz: +2-3dB (improve speech presence)
High-pass filter: 50Hz (clean up low-end)
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Estimated Treatment Costs
- **Corner Treatment:** $2,000-3,000 (4 corners, professional materials)
- **Bass Trapping:** $1,500-2,500 (strategic placement)
- **Ceiling Treatment:** $1,000-1,500 (cloud system)
- **Diffusion:** $500-1,000 (rear wall treatment)

**Total Estimated Cost:** $5,000-8,000

### Benefits
- **Improved speech intelligibility** by 15-20dB in problem areas
- **Reduced acoustic fatigue** for talent and crew
- **Professional broadcast quality** sound
- **Reduced post-production EQ requirements**

## Conclusion

Studio 8 requires significant acoustic treatment to meet professional broadcast standards. The current condition severely compromises speech intelligibility and would result in poor audio quality without extensive corrective measures.

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Use only Std8-HostA position until treatment is completed
2. Implement EQ correction for 125Hz peak
3. Begin corner treatment installation (Priority 1)
4. Avoid all corner positions for any equipment placement

**Long-term Solution:**
Complete the recommended treatment plan to transform Studio 8 into a professional-grade broadcast facility with excellent speech clarity and minimal acoustic artifacts.
